Computer Science is about computers and computation; the essence of the discipline is the study of algorithms — the design, development, and characterization of algorithms, their realization as computer programs, the analysis of the correctness and efficiency of algorithms, and the limitations of the algorithmic method as an approach to problem solving. The department’s offerings include an introduction to the discipline, thus including programming, data structures, and discrete mathematics; core courses in theoretical computer science, computer languages, computer organization, algorithm analysis and software systems design; advanced courses in compiler design, operating systems, and distributed systems; and a variety of applications and electives. The human dimensions of computing — social, professional, and ethical implications — are treated throughout the department’s courses. Courses frequently feature collaborative and interdisciplinary in-class exercises and out-of-class assignments.

The Department of Computer Science features courses that have an integral laboratory component — nearly all of the courses include a weekly formal laboratory session to provide for practice and experimentation using the scientific principles learned in the classroom and from study of the course texts. The laboratory component affords the opportunity for hands-on experience with a wide-variety of computer hardware and software systems (e.g., integrated development environments, version control systems, semi-autonomous robots, and mobile devices). The Department of Computer Science has laboratories adjacent to faculty offices and classrooms in Alden Hall, including an advanced-technology computer science classroom that facilitates active learning; a software development laboratory designed for the team-based development of large software systems; and a laboratory for advanced coursework and research.
